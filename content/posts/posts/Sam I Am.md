The amount of times I've been asked "do you like green eggs and ham" is uncountable. To the point where I won't even allow the book in my house.

My name is Sam Arnold. I'm a 30-something-year-old father, husband, pet owner, tech-lover, video/board/table-top-role-playing gamer, space and science enthusiast, reader, and so many other things. I have been working in/as Quality Assurance/Engineering since 2017. My time in QA has taught me a lot about professionalism, workplace communication, punctuality, and other general professional career skills. I've performed manual tests, automated tests, and accessibility tests on websites, mobile applications, and Point-of-sale systems. 

The primary purpose of this website/blog is to document my journey of becoming a more well rounded IT professional. I graduated with a degree in Information and Telecommunication Systems but since then, I have rarely used my degree in any sort of professional context. My career has been spent mostly on the front end of websites until I came to Wendy's. At Wendy's, I've been able to get my hands on technologies used in restaurants. Back-of-house servers, Point-of-Sale terminals, menu boards, payment devices, customer facing displays, kitchen devices, and some networking equipment. 

"In QA, failure is always an option." If I had to boil down a career in QA/QE into two words, those words would be "break things." However, I've found myself less and less satisfied with breaking. I want to also build and fix things and in QA, that just isn't possible. So I've found it's time to learn how to plan, build, release, and maintain devices and software. 

My first steps in my learning process were studying and ultimately passing the Comptia A+ certification. I've also built myself a homelab of an old Dell desktop and a mini hp computer. This lab is where I plan to learn and practice a number of different technology projects and challenges.

I will go into detail about my homelab in my next post!

Thank you for reading,
Sam

P.S. I'll probably write posts about some of my other interests as well. I'll try and make my simple little website have a way to filter topics.
