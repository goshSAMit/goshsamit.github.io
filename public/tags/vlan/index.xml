      <description>Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) Basics In my home, I was looking for a way to keep my personal devices separate from any smart devices, as those devices can be less secure.

      <description>Intro This is a walk-through guide of how I set up home network and how to set up VLANs on a TP-Link Managed Switch.
My network at home is set into 3 Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN). The first is VLAN 1, and it is the default network that my family&amp;rsquo;s everyday devices connect to. The second is VLAN 20. It is for smart devices that have questionable security vulnerabilities. I buy devices that I generally trust, but you can&amp;rsquo;t be too careful.</description>
