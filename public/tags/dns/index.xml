      <description>Project I was getting tired of entering IP addresses and having to click through the &amp;ldquo;connection not secure&amp;rdquo; messaging to get into my homelab services. I found a video by TechnoTim on YouTube where he walks through the &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; of setting up Traefik as a cert manager and local DNS records on PiHole. So instead of copying his tutorial, I will just link it here.
 TechnoTim&amp;rsquo;s website with tutorial TechnoTim&amp;rsquo;s Youtube tutorial  Domain Name System Part of this project focuses on creating local Domain Name System (DNS) records, which allow you to access services in a browser using domain names instead of IP addresses.</description>
