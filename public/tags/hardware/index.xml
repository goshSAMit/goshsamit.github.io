      <description>My home lab came about from asking the question &amp;ldquo;how am I supposed to get an IT job that requires experience, without experience?&amp;rdquo; On top of new responsibilities at my current role, my home lab is a great place to practice, learn, try new things, and fail, all without worry about taking down production.
I figure my hardware is a good place to start. I&amp;rsquo;ll make a list of all the hardware and what I am doing with it or what I plan to do with it.</description>
