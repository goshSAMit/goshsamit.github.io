        <p>The amount of times I&rsquo;ve been asked &ldquo;do you like green eggs and ham&rdquo; is uncountable. To the point where I won&rsquo;t even allow the book in my house.</p>
<p>My name is Sam Arnold. I&rsquo;m a 30-something-year-old father, husband, pet owner, tech-lover, video/board/table-top-role-playing gamer, space and science enthusiast, reader, and so many other things. I have been working in/as Quality Assurance/Engineering since 2017. My time in QA has taught me a lot about professionalism, workplace communication, punctuality, and other general professional career skills. I&rsquo;ve performed manual tests, automated tests, and accessibility tests on websites, mobile applications, and Point-of-sale systems.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this website/blog is to document my journey of becoming a more well rounded IT professional. I graduated with a degree in Information and Telecommunication Systems but since then, I have rarely used my degree in any sort of professional context. My career has been spent mostly on the front end of websites until I came to Wendy&rsquo;s. At Wendy&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve been able to get my hands on technologies used in restaurants. Back-of-house servers, Point-of-Sale terminals, menu boards, payment devices, customer facing displays, kitchen devices, and some networking equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In QA, failure is always an option.&rdquo; If I had to boil down a career in QA/QE into two words, those words would be &ldquo;break things.&rdquo; However, I&rsquo;ve found myself less and less satisfied with breaking. I want to also build and fix things and in QA, that just isn&rsquo;t possible. So I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s time to learn how to plan, build, release, and maintain devices and software.</p>
<p>My first steps in my learning process were studying and ultimately passing the Comptia A+ certification. I&rsquo;ve also built myself a homelab of an old Dell desktop and a mini hp computer. This lab is where I plan to learn and practice a number of different technology projects and challenges.</p>
<p>I will go into detail about my homelab in my next post!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading,
Sam</p>
<p>P.S. I&rsquo;ll probably write posts about some of my other interests as well. I&rsquo;ll try and make my simple little website have a way to filter topics.</p>
