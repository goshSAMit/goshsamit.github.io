      <description>The amount of times I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked &amp;ldquo;do you like green eggs and ham&amp;rdquo; is uncountable. To the point where I won&amp;rsquo;t even allow the book in my house.
My name is Sam Arnold. I&amp;rsquo;m a 30-something-year-old father, husband, pet owner, tech-lover, video/board/table-top-role-playing gamer, space and science enthusiast, reader, and so many other things. I have been working in/as Quality Assurance/Engineering since 2017. My time in QA has taught me a lot about professionalism, workplace communication, punctuality, and other general professional career skills.</description>
