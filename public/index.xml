      <description>Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) Basics In my home, I was looking for a way to keep my personal devices separate from any smart devices, as those devices can be less secure. One way I could handle this is to set up two Local Area Networks (LAN), one for my personal devices and one for the smart devices. Each would have their own switch and connection to the router and neither would be able to talk to the other.</description>

      <title>Homepage Dashboard</title>

      <description>Intro Homepage is a simple dashboard allowing users to set up a single page to get a quick view of services running on their network, resource utilization, and important links. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good project to start working with docker containers, as you can create a docker container to run your homepage instance, which is what this guide will show.
 If you would like to see the configuration files for my own homepage dashboard, please follow this link.</description>

      <title>Home Network</title>

      <description>Intro This is a walk-through guide of how I set up home network and how to set up VLANs on a TP-Link Managed Switch.
My network at home is set into 3 Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN). The first is VLAN 1, and it is the default network that my family&amp;rsquo;s everyday devices connect to. The second is VLAN 20. It is for smart devices that have questionable security vulnerabilities. I buy devices that I generally trust, but you can&amp;rsquo;t be too careful.</description>

      <title>Home Lab Hardware</title>

      <description>My home lab came about from asking the question &amp;ldquo;how am I supposed to get an IT job that requires experience, without experience?&amp;rdquo; On top of new responsibilities at my current role, my home lab is a great place to practice, learn, try new things, and fail, all without worry about taking down production.
I figure my hardware is a good place to start. I&amp;rsquo;ll make a list of all the hardware and what I am doing with it or what I plan to do with it.</description>
